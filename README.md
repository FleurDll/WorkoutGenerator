This fullstack application generates custom workout sessions. <br>
Here are the features of this app :

- Generate a new workouts until you find the perfect one.
- The session is designed according to a particular sequence : 3 upperbody and 3 lowerbody exercises that never target the same muscle (we want to be able to survive it).
- Once you're ready, you can start the countdown. You'll see the pattern : 60s ou 45s of effort and a 15s break. You can pause the countdown.
- When the workout is over, you can save it and find it back in the "saved workouts" section. And play it again.
- Admin path to unlock to possibility to add or remove an exercise.

## Motivation

I used to take a paper and write down my sequence of sports exercises just before my workout. It has become boring and repetitive. <br>
I therefore imagined an application which had all my exercises in database and which could generate perfect workouts for me. <br>
So I created my server with Express and connected it to my MongoDB database. <br>
Then I created a React app and manage all the different actions with Redux (add/remove exercises, fetch exercises, fetch saved sessions, ...). <br>
Now my athletic life is simplified!
